# EZ Menu (working name)

# About
This app started as a restaurant menu creator used to create and publish menus to public links that could then be accessed by customers, embedded in websites and displayed on in-store monitors via a RaspberryPi. It is currently being used as is by 1 restaurant. I am now working on extending it to further use cases. The ability to create standalone objects with their own public links creates a lot of opportunities.

Currently it is a simple menu making application that stores user data and menu data in a MySQL database and publishes menus to public objects on Google Storage. Menus are pages rendered with their own CSS and JS so they can be embedded in other sites or accessed via other devices and behave consistently.  Uses Firebase for authentication, Google App Engine to run the backend, Google Cloud SQL to store user data and Google Storage to publish file objects.

RaspberryPis are used to display menus on screens for easily updated menus or kiosks. Currently the Pis' OSs have to be manually setup and code manually installed. Eventually they will be flashed with the same OS image and executables and they will be accessible via a wifi access point to easily connect the Pi to Wifi and select menu to display.

## Setup
You'll need to have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) and the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/?hl=en)
installed and initialized to an App Engine project before running the code in
this sample.

1. Clone this repo:

        git clone https://github.com/dylanrdrake/ez-menu.git

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

        cd ez-menu/backend

1. Install the 3rd-party dependencies to the backend service:

        pip install -t lib/ -r requirements.txt

    if you get python3 print statement error, remove * in lib/, install pip2.7 and:

        pip2.7 install -t lib/ -r requirements.txt

1. To access a Cloud SQL database instance (or any database):

    - create file: backend/env_config.py to store sensitive logins, passwords and keys. The .gitignore will block these from being pushed to Github.


1. [Add Firebase to your app.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app)
1. Add your Firebase project ID to the backendâ€™s `app.yaml` file as an
environment variable.
1. Select which providers you want to enable. Delete the providers from
`main.js` that you do no want to offer. Enable the providers you chose to keep
in the Firebase console under **Auth** > **Sign-in Method** >
**Sign-in providers**.
1. In the Firebase console, under **OAuth redirect domains**, click
**Add Domain** and enter the domain of your app on App Engine:
[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com. Do not include "http://" before the domain name.

## Run Locally
1. Install AppEngine included libaries listed in backend/app.yaml into your system python:

        pip install <package>

    These will automatically be imported into the runtime when deployed to AppEngine 

1. Uncomment the backend host URL in `main.js`: http://localhost:8081.

1. Navigate to the root directory of the application and start the development
server with the following command:

        dev_appserver.py frontend/app.yaml backend/app.yaml

1. Visit [http://locahost:8080/](http://locahost:8080/) in a web browser.

## Deploy
1. Change the backend host URL in `main.js` to
https://backend-dot-[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com.
1. Deploy the application using the Cloud SDK command-line interface:

        gcloud app deploy frontend/app.yaml backend/app.yaml

    The Cloud Datastore indexes can take a while to update, so the application
    might not be fully functional immediately after deployment.

1. View the application live at https://[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com.
